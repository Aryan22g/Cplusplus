//ek soch h aur soch se programmes bnane ka ek tareeka h

/*why oops:
c++ was made to add object orientd feature (to add classes) to c
size of program increases , readability, maintainability and bug free nature of program decreases.
we can address problems in a program in effective manner
data security increases
program can be modeleld as real world scenarios
*/

/*procedure oriented programming
consists of writing a set of instructions for computer to follow
main focus is on functions not on flow of data
fn can either be local or global data
data moves openly from function to function*/

/*oops
works on concepts of classes and objects
a class is atemplate to create object
treats data as a critical elemet
decomposes the problem in objects and builds data and functions around the objects*/

/*Basic concepts in oops
classes- basic template for creating objects
objects-basic run time entities
data abstraction and encapsulation- wrapping data and fn into single unit 
inheritance-properties of one class can be inherited into others
polymorphism- ability to take more than one forms
Dynamic Binding- code which will execute is not known until the program runs
Message Passing- object message(information) call format*/

/*
Benefits of oops
better code reusability using objects and inheritance
principle of data hiding helps build secure systems
multiple objects can coexist without any interference
software complexity can easily be managed*/
